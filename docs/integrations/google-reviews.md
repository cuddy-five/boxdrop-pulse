# Google reviews

## Review link
- Use the short review URL from Google Business Profile.
- Keep it stable and store in config.

## Policy note
- Some platforms discourage or prohibit review gating (only asking happy customers).
- Consider asking all customers to leave a public review, and use a separate private feedback link for complaints.

## Recommendation
- If you keep the rating split, document the risk and update policy language.
